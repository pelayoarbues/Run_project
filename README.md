Run_project
===========
This repo is the project assignment of Coursera's course Cleaning and getting data.

CodeBook.md collects all information on variables description and data cleaning and transformation. 

run_analysis.R is the only script that needs to be run in order to build two tidy datasets: 
- TidyData.txt This dataset is the result of merging test and train datasets plus labelling values and variables. It contains mean and standard deviation of all measurements
- tidy_avg_data.txt This dataset contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
